Coming from an educated and scientific background, Dad \u000d\u000awas initially closed off to the idea of God and religion. For years, he believed the barrier \u000d\u000awas intellectual, that his mind could not reconcile faith with reason. But through divine \u000d\u000awisdom, he discovered the real issue was not in the mind, it was in the heart. Pride had \u000d\u000akept his heart turned away from God.\u000d\u000aWhile he credited Mom for ultimately leading him to Christ, this realization transformed \u000d\u000ahis life. It led him to acceptance, faith, and a deeper appreciation for the beauty and order \u000d\u000aof God\u2019s creation. Dad had hoped to share this sermon himself, but God had different \u000d\u000aplans. Today, we share it on his behalf, praying that it reaches someone who, like him, \u000d\u000awrestles with questions of faith and reason. May this message help you see what God \u000d\u000aallowed Dad to see; that the cure is not earned but freely given through grace.\u000d\u000a- Melissa, Elyssa, Dunham and Nathan","A Little Personal History\u000d\u000aThe Early Years\u000d\u000a\u26ac Grew up in a Christian heritage home, not a believing home.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Celebrated Christmas and Easter at home, did not go to Church.\u000d\u000a\u26ac God was not a subject for discussion.\u000d\u000a\u26ac My mother\u2019s father was the only person I knew who knew God personally.\u000d\u000aHigh school years\u000d\u000a\u26ac Contemplated God, but did not pursue Him, minimal reading of the Bible\u000d\u000a\u26ac Met Diana senior year\u000d\u000aCollege Years \u2013 VA Tech\u000d\u000a\u26ac Refused to discuss God with Christian students - would not go there, I could not deny \u000d\u000aHim either.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Majored in Electrical Engineering, but fell in love with Mathematics (yes, it is possible)\u000d\u000a\u26ac When God created our universe, He also created the mathematics that governs its \u000d\u000abehavior.\u000d\u000a\uffed Some say that God is a Mathematician \u2013 see the Irony? (While avoiding God, I fell in \u000d\u000alove with his creation language.)\u000d\u000a\uffed This leads us to The First Beauty","God\u2019s Creation \u2013 The First Beauty\u000d\u000aGod Completes His Creation\u000d\u000aGod is a creator of order, simplicity and elegance.\u000d\u000a\u26ac All electrical phenomenon can be described by 4 equations that govern the interaction \u000d\u000aof electrical charge, electrical fields, and magnetic fields\u000d\u000a\u25aa This includes electrical distribution to your home, operation of your phones, your \u000d\u000acomputer, your gaming console, your microwave, and the cell communications\u000d\u000a\u26ac God uses the same mathematical language and principles to define His laws that \u000d\u000acontrol how His creation is to behave, whether it is in Physics, Chemistry, or Biology\u000d\u000a\u25aa As an example, DNA is a highly efficient and elegant storage mechanism for the \u000d\u000acode that governs both cellular, as well as body form and behavior.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Is it any wonder when God completed His creation, He found it to be \u201cvery good\u201d?\u000d\u000aNow for the Tragedy\u2026\u000d\u000aGen 1:31 God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was \u000d\u000amorning, the sixth day.","The Fall, Which Leads to the Tragedy\u000d\u000aGen 3:1-7 Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said \u000d\u000ato the woman, \"Indeed, has God said, \u2019You shall not eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201d The woman said to the \u000d\u000aserpent, \"From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle \u000d\u000aof the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe serpent said to the woman, \"You surely will not die! For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes \u000d\u000awill be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was \u000d\u000adesirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. \u000d\u000aThen the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves \u000d\u000atogether and made themselves loin coverings.\u000d\u000aGen 3:22-24 Then the LORD God said, \"Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and \u000d\u000anow, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever\"\u2014 therefore the \u000d\u000aLORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken. So He drove \u000d\u000athe man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned \u000d\u000aevery direction to guard the way to the tree of life.","Separation from God \u2013 The Tragedy\u000d\u000aWhy is this separation necessary?\u000d\u000a\u26ac With eternal life, mankind would live in a state of eternal sin, with no personal \u000d\u000arelationship with God.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Sinful man can not have relationship with a Holy God. \u000d\u000a\u26ac Man can not cure his sinful nature.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Mosaic Covenant (The Ten Commandments) \u2013 How did that work out?\u000d\u000aThe Mercy Seat of God in the Tabernacle and the Temple\u000d\u000a\u26ac Blocked by the veil, for man\u2019s protection\u000d\u000a\u26ac Ultimately God leaves the Temple\u000d\u000aRom 8:7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of \u000d\u000aGod, for it is not even able to do so,\u000d\u000aEzk 10:18-19 Then the glory of the LORD departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the \u000d\u000acherubim. When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose up from the earth in my sight with \u000d\u000athe wheels beside them; and they stood still at the entrance of the east gate of the LORD'S house, and the \u000d\u000aglory of the God of Israel hovered over them.\u000d\u000aPsa 5:4 For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with You.","The Second Beauty\u000d\u000aSinless Perfection Re-enters Creation\u000d\u000a\u26ac Testified by the Father\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus is fully man and fully God\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus fully submits to the Father\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus is without sin.\u000d\u000aMat 3:16-17 After being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were \u000d\u000aopened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold, a voice out of \u000d\u000athe heavens said, \"This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.\u201d\u000d\u000aHeb 2:17 Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things, so that He might become a merciful \u000d\u000aand faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. \u000d\u000aHeb 1:3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all \u000d\u000athings by the word of His power.\u000d\u000aJhn 5:30 \"I can do nothing on My own initiative. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not \u000d\u000aseek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.\u000d\u000aHeb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has \u000d\u000abeen tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.","The Second Beauty (Cont\u2019d)\u000d\u000aJesus Provides the Cure\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus is in creation but not from creation \u2013 His divinity gives Him infinite value\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus uses His obedience to the Father, His infinite value and death on the cross to \u000d\u000aredeem His creation \u000d\u000aThe Evidence \u2013 The Resurrection\u000d\u000a\u26ac The empty tomb \u2013 without any reasonable explanation\u000d\u000a\u26ac Jesus returned to over 500 witnesses\u000d\u000a\u26ac The death and resurrection is the best documented historical event from all of \u000d\u000aantiquity.\u000d\u000aRom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.","The Rest of the Story\u000d\u000aAt the age of 30 God put me where he wanted me.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Diana gave her life to Christ.\u000d\u000a\u26ac We had 3 young children.\u000d\u000a\u26ac I could not avoid God any longer.\u000d\u000aLike most rationally minded people, I had convinced myself \u000d\u000athat the problem of belief was intellectual.\u000d\u000aGod took me on a journey to discover the real issue\u2026\u000d\u000a\u26ac It laid in the pride of the heart.\u000d\u000a\u26ac The heart (soul/spirit) controls the mind.\u000d\u000a\u26ac This explains why so many secular arguments against God and His Creation are \u000d\u000aultimately irrational.\u000d\u000a\u26ac I have seen brilliant physicists in my career make a flawed rational analysis based \u000d\u000aon pre-conceived ideas and intuitions.\u000d\u000a\u26ac So, what I discovered led me to what I coin as The Mystery","The Mystery \u2026\u000d\u000aHow does one obtain the cure?\u000d\u000a\u26ac It is a free gift.\u000d\u000a\u26ac It is not earned.\u000d\u000a\u26ac It requires repentance, leading to faith\u000d\u000aWhere does the gift come from?\u000d\u000a\u26ac It is offered by Jesus from His death on the cross.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Again, it cannot be earned.\u000d\u000aWhere does the faith come from?\u000d\u000a\u26ac God provides the faith. \u000d\u000aWhat is our role?\u000d\u000a\u26ac Repentance or an opening of the heart toward God\u000d\u000a\u26ac The pride of the heart keeps us from God and the Holy Spirit convicts us to open our \u000d\u000aheart to God and humble our pride toward God\u000d\u000a\u26ac When we do this, God provides the basis for our faith through His Word, His Holy Spirit \u000d\u000aand at times through His people\u000d\u000aEph 2:8-9 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; \u000d\u000anot as a result of works, so that no one may boast.","What Do We Do With These Truths?\u000d\u000aFor The Unbeliever\u000d\u000a\u26ac Recognize that your issue with God is ultimately the pride of the heart, not rationality \u000d\u000aof the mind. That is what I thought (a lie from Satan), but I was wrong.\u000d\u000a\u26ac If you are in internal conflict, this is likely the conviction of Holy Spirt trying to open \u000d\u000ayour heart.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Be willing to open your heart toward God and set aside your pride, you will be amazed \u000d\u000aat how God will do the rest.\u000d\u000aFor The Believer\u000d\u000a\u26ac We as believers often do not open all of our heart to God, we hold back.\u000d\u000a\u26ac Holy Spirit will not enter where He is not invited.\u000d\u000a\u26ac This can lead to incomplete healing, hurts, resentments and guilt over past experiences \u000d\u000aremain. Leaving us with not forgiving ourselves or others.\u000d\u000a\u26ac God wants to heal us completely \u2013 let Him.","I come to the garden alone,\u000d\u000aWhile the dew is still on the roses,\u000d\u000aAnd the voice I hear falling on my ear\u000d\u000aThe Son of God discloses.\u000d\u000aRefrain:\u000d\u000aAnd He walks with me, and He talks with me,\u000d\u000aAnd He tells me I am His own;\u000d\u000aAnd the joy we share as we tarry there,\u000d\u000aNone other has ever known.\u000d\u000aHe speaks, and the sound of His voice\u000d\u000aIs so sweet the birds hush their singing,\u000d\u000aAnd the melody that He gave to me\u000d\u000aWithin my heart is ringing.\u000d\u000aI\u2019d stay in the garden with Him,\u000d\u000aThough the night around me be falling,\u000d\u000aBut He bids me go; through the voice of woe\u000d\u000aHis voice to me is calling."]
